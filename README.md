Instructions on how to interact with the work: Every time the user refreshes the web page, the graphics coded with Perlin noise will create a random effect.

Details of my individual approach to animating the group code:

I chose Perlin noise to drive my code.

Some additional small red rectangles are added to the group artwork, generated at random positions using Perlin noise coding, and randomly moved within a certain range. Some additional blue rectangular lines are added behind the yellow rectangular lines from the group work and are randomly moved up and down using Perlin noise coding. Behind the original group shapes, additional grey quadrilaterals are randomly rotated rapidly using Perlin noise coding to create the gear effect. Some originally stationary rectangles (red, blue, grey) from the group artwork now move rapidly from random positions within the yellow rectangular lines.

The inspiration for animating my individual code:

Below is a screenshot of the circular wave dynamic effect generated by Perlin noise. It inspired me to add the small red rectangles coded with Perlin noise I mentioned above. Although the rectangle cannot show the effect of waves, the movement trajectory can be similar to it and create an effect that constantly changes between gathering and spreading.

As the original rectangular lines and rectangles of the group artwork gave me a sense of simulating production lines (like underground construction sites), it gave me the idea to add moving gears with Perlin noise behind the rectangular linesâ€™ background. A symbolic effect.

A short technical explanation:

In the function draw (), I added the additional rectangles and rectangular lines with Perlin noise coding to adjust the position and movement of the squares and lines, and rotation of the quadrilaterals. I also added the rotating angle setting and time setting.
